SERVLET

Calling a servlet from a servlet:
1. First option is to use RequestDispatcher
	-setAttribute() to HttpServletRequest and forward the same HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse to the servlet that is needed to be called using the RequestDispatcher and getAttribute() in the servlet
	being called
2. Second option is to use Redirecting
	-maintain first the HttpSession to get a hold of the data from the client through request.getSession() and;
	-setAttribute in the held HttpSession, and;
	-sendRedirect() to the servlet that needs to be called using the HttpServletResponse
	-in the servlet being called, get in instance of HttpSession and from that session, getAttribute() the earlier setAttribute();
		-ASIDE FROM USING HttpSession, you can also use Cookies to store client information
